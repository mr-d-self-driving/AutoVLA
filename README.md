- AutoVLA integrates **chain-of-thought reasoning** and **physical action tokenization** to directly generate planning trajectories through a unified autoregressive process, dynamically switching dual-thinking modes.
- **Supervised fine-tuning (RFT)** is employed to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking (trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning). 
- **Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT)** based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is adopted to further enhance planning performance and efficiency, reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios.
- Extensive experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including **nuPlan**, **nuScenes**, **Waymo**, and **CARLA**, demonstrate its competitive performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings.
